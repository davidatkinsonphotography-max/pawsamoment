        <p>We are a very small group of dedicated volunteers who assist in rehoming animals in need.</p><p> All the animals who come into care are placed in loving foster homes while they await vet work to be done and in some cases, rehabilitation.</p><p>

Once the animal is ready for adoption, they will be advertised via our FB page and also Pet Rescue to find their forever home. </p><p>Adopters will be asked to provide answers to a range of questions so that we can be assured they are going to the best homes. Yard/house checks may also be carried out prior to an adoption.</p><p>

We also aim to educate the public on responsible pet ownership and the importance of desexing your pets. To reduce the number of Dogs and Cats euthanised each year in Pounds/Shelters.</p><p>

All our animals available for adoption will come Microchipped, Vaccinated, Desexed, Wormed and Flea Treated. They will all have had a complete vet check prior to adoption.</p>

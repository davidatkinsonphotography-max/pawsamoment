        <p>All animals listed on this website are in the care of, or rehomed through, Paws a Moment and Rescue.</p>
        <p>Animals are living beings, not products. While we do our best to assess health and temperament, we cannot guarantee the behaviour, health or suitability of any animal.</p>

            <li>any injury, loss or damage caused by an animal</li>
            <li>any outcome of an adoption</li>
            <li>any reliance on information provided on this website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Responsibility for the care, handling and supervision of an adopted animal rests with the adopter once the adoption is completed.</p>

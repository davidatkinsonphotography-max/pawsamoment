        <p>We’re Paws a Moment and Rescue (ABN 68 755 630 431). We help animals find homes, and we take looking after people’s personal information seriously too. No funny business. Only the good kind.</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and what choices you have. It follows the Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).</p>
        
        <p>By using our website or giving us your information, you agree to this policy.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">What information we collect</h3>
        <p>We only collect information that we need to run our rescue and help you interact with us. This may include:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <li>your name</li>
            <li>contact details like email, phone number or address</li>
            <li>information you give us when you enquire about a pet, donate, subscribe, or contact us</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you don’t provide certain information, we might not be able to help you adopt a pet, process a donation, or respond properly. Sadly, even puppies need paperwork.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">Can I use a nickname or alias?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, yes. You can usually use a nickname or pseudonym when dealing with us.</p>
        <p>But if you’re adopting a pet, registering as a rescue group, or doing anything that needs identity checks, we’ll need your real details. The animals insist on responsible humans.</p>
        <p>If you give us information about someone else, please make sure they’re OK with that and know about this policy.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">How we use your information</h3>
        <p>We use your information to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <li>respond to enquiries</li>
            <li>manage adoptions and pet listings</li>
            <li>process donations and payments</li>
            <li>send newsletters or updates if you opt in</li>
            <li>improve our website and services</li>
            <li>meet legal requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We don’t use your information for anything unrelated without your consent. We’re a rescue, not a snooping cat.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">Emails, newsletters and updates</h3>
        <p>If you subscribe to newsletters or updates, we’ll use your details to send them to you. You can unsubscribe at any time. No guilt. No sad puppy eyes. Just click unsubscribe.</p>
        <p>If you choose to receive offers or updates from partners, we’ll only share your information where you have clearly opted in.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">Adoption enquiries and pet profiles</h3>
        <p>If you enquire about a pet, your information may be shared with the rescue group caring for that animal so they can contact you.</p>
        <p>If you share a pet profile with someone else, we’ll use the details you provide to send that information. We promise not to turn it into spam.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">Donations and payments</h3>
        <p>When you donate or buy something, your payment details are handled by trusted third-party payment providers. We receive only what we need to confirm and manage your donation.</p>
        <p>We never see or store your full payment details. Even we don’t have that kind of access.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">Website data, cookies and analytics</h3>
        <p>Like most websites, we collect basic technical information such as IP address and browser type. This helps us understand how people use the site and how to make it better.</p>
        <p>We use cookies. Not the chocolate chip kind. The internet kind.</p>
        <p>You can control cookies through your browser settings or opt out using tools like: <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/opt-out" target="_blank" style="color: #6A5ACD;">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/opt-out</a></p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">Sharing your information</h3>
        <p>We may share your information:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <li>with service providers who help us operate</li>
            <li>with rescue partners for adoption enquiries</li>
            <li>where required by law</li>
            <li>to protect our rights, users or animals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some service providers are located overseas, including in the USA, Canada and Singapore. We take reasonable steps to make sure your information is handled in line with Australian privacy standards.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">How we store and protect your information</h3>
        <p>We store information securely using a mix of systems and trusted third-party services. We take reasonable steps to protect it from loss, misuse or unauthorised access.</p>
        <p>No system is perfect, but we don’t leave the gate open either.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">Accessing or correcting your information</h3>
        <p>You can ask to access or correct your personal information at any time. Just contact us and we’ll respond within a reasonable time.</p>
        <p>Keeping records accurate matters. Especially when pets are involved.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">Deleting your information</h3>
        <p>You can ask us to delete your account or information. We’ll do so unless we’re required to keep it for legal or record-keeping reasons.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-top: 40px;">Complaints or concerns</h3>

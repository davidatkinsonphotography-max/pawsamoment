            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Paws a Moment & Rescue will disclose all known behavioural/health issues relating directly to your new pet, but cannot take responsibility for the pet should it suffer ill health and/or develop an unsatisfactory temperament after the trial period.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">We offer a 14-day trial period on all our animals. This allows time for your new pet to ‘settle in’ and gives reasonable time to determine if your new pet fits in well with your home.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">We will provide support via phone/Facebook with any issues that may arise during the trial period and encourage you to join our closed ‘Adopters’ page on Facebook for ongoing support.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Prior to adoption, all animals will be Microchipped, Desexed, Vaccinated, Wormed and Flea Treated, and all paperwork will be provided to you once the trial period starts.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">At completion of the trial period, we will submit change of ownership paperwork to Council (you will be copied in on the email), so the animal can be transferred into your name.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Adopting through Paws a Moment & Rescue entitles you to FREE Lifetime Registration for this animal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 style="color: #483D8B; margin-bottom: 20px;">Your Commitment</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You agree to maintain and house the animal under the conditions of the NSW Companion Animals Act (or other relevant State laws) governing the care of companion animals and meet all council bylaws.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You agree to contact the group immediately should any problems arise during the 14-day trial period, including the animal becoming lost or if you have any health or behavioural concerns.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You agree to keep the animal’s microchip and ID details updated and correct at all times.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You agree to provide all necessary vet treatment, including vaccinations, parasite control, and immediate treatment of any illness or injury.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You agree to provide a loving, safe home for your new pet and treat them as part of the family.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">For cats, you agree to keep your cat indoors or in an enclosed outdoor area at all times, not left to roam.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You agree that if at any point during your pet’s life, you are no longer able to care for them, you will not surrender them to the Pound or sell/give away to anyone other than Paws a Moment & Rescue. If we are not in a position to take the animal back into care, then an Assisted Rehome will be offered.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You will take responsibility for any damage or injury caused by the animal during the 14-day trial period.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">You understand that the adoption fee helps to cover the cost of all vet work and therefore, is not refundable for adult pets. Kittens and puppies under 3 months old will have a $50 non-refundable amount, with the remainder of the adoption fee reimbursed if the animal is returned during the 14-day trial period.</li>
            </ul>

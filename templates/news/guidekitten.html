    <p>Welcome to the family! Here is your guide to caring for your new kitten.</p>
    
    <section id="preparing-home">
        <h2>Preparing Your Home</h2>
        <p>Before your kitten arrives, take some time to kitten-proof your home. This means securing any potential hazards, such as:</p>
        
        <div class="custom-bullet-list">
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Electrical cords:</strong> Tuck them away or cover them to prevent chewing.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Toxic substances:</strong> Store cleaning supplies, medications, and chemicals out of reach.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Small objects:</strong> Remove anything that could be swallowed, like rubber bands, paper clips, or string.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Houseplants:</strong> Identify and remove any plants that are toxic to cats.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Unstable furniture:</strong> Secure bookshelves or tall lamps that could be knocked over.</div>

        <p>Create a safe and comfortable space for your kitten where they can retreat and feel secure. This could be a spare room, a quiet corner, or even just a cosy bed in a central location. Make sure they have easy access to their food, water, litter box, and scratching post.</p>

    <section id="first-days">
        <h2>The First Few Days</h2>
        <div class="custom-bullet-list">
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Confine them to a small area:</strong> This will help them feel more secure and make it easier for them to find their resources (food, water, litter box).</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Offer food and water:</strong> Place their bowls nearby and encourage them to eat and drink.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Show them the litter box:</strong> Gently place them in the litter box so they know where it is. Don't worry if they don't use it right away.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Provide gentle interaction:</strong> Talk to them softly and offer a gentle scratch under the chin if they seem receptive. Avoid forcing interaction.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Be patient:</strong> It may take a few days or even weeks for your kitten to fully adjust to their new home. Don't get discouraged if they hide or seem scared. Just continue to provide a safe and loving environment.</div>

    <section id="feeding-kitten">
        <h2>Feeding Your Kitten</h2>
        <p>Kittens have different nutritional needs than adult cats. They require a diet that is high in protein and calories to support their rapid growth and development. Choose a kitten food that is specifically formulated for kittens. You can feed your kitten wet food, dry food, or a combination of both.</p>
        <p>Wet food is more palatable and can help keep your kitten hydrated. Dry food is more convenient and can help keep their teeth clean. Be sure to read the ingredient list and choose a food that is made with high-quality ingredients and contains no artificial colours, flavours, or preservatives.</p>
        
        <div class="feeding-guidelines">
            <h3>Feeding Guidelines:</h3>
            <div class="custom-bullet-list">
                <div class="custom-bullet-item">● Always provide fresh, clean water.</div>
                <div class="custom-bullet-item">● Feed a high-quality kitten food.</div>
                <div class="custom-bullet-item">● Follow the feeding guidelines on the food packaging.</div>
                <div class="custom-bullet-item">● Divide their daily food into multiple small meals.</div>

            <div class="custom-bullet-list">
                <div class="custom-bullet-item">● Chocolate</div>
                <div class="custom-bullet-item">● Onions and garlic</div>

    <section id="litter-training">
        <h2>Litter Box Training</h2>
        <p>Litter box training is usually a relatively easy process for kittens. Here are a few tips to help:</p>
        <div class="custom-bullet-list">
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Choose the right litter box:</strong> Select a litter box that is appropriately sized for your kitten. A low-sided box is often easier for kittens to enter and exit, however high sides can help contain mess.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Choose the right litter:</strong> Experiment with different types of litter to see what your kitten prefers. Avoid scented litters, as these can be irritating to some cats.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Place the litter box in a quiet, accessible location:</strong> Make sure the litter box is easily accessible to your kitten and is in a quiet area away from their food and water.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Show your kitten the litter box:</strong> After meals and naps, gently place your kitten in the litter box. They may naturally start to dig and eliminate.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Clean the litter box regularly:</strong> Scoop the litter box at least once a day and completely change the litter once a week.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Reward your kitten for using the litter box:</strong> When your kitten uses the litter box, praise them and offer a small treat.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Never punish your kitten for accidents:</strong> If your kitten has an accident outside of the litter box, clean it up thoroughly and don't punish them. Punishment can create fear and anxiety, which can worsen the problem.</div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="grooming">
        <h2>Grooming</h2>
        <p>Regular grooming is important for keeping your kitten healthy and happy. It helps to remove loose fur, prevent mats, and distribute natural oils throughout their coat.</p>
        <img src="{% static 'img/kittenPicture4.jpg' %}" alt="Kitten Cartoon Image 4" class="guide-image">
        <div class="custom-bullet-list">
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Brushing:</strong> Brush your kitten regularly, especially if they have long hair. This will help to remove loose fur and prevent mats.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Nail trimming:</strong> Trim your kitten's nails every few weeks to prevent them from scratching furniture or people.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Ear cleaning:</strong> Check your kitten's ears regularly for dirt and debris. Clean them with a cotton ball and a veterinarian-approved ear cleaner.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Bathing:</strong> Kittens generally don't need to be bathed unless they get very dirty. If you do need to bathe your kitten, use a shampoo that is specifically formulated for cats.</div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="socialization-play">
        <h2>Socialization and Play</h2>
        <p>Socialization is crucial for kittens to develop into well-adjusted adults. Expose your kitten to a variety of sights, sounds, smells, and people in a positive and controlled manner.</p>

    <section id="health-care">
        <h2>Health Care</h2>
        <p>Regular veterinary care is essential for keeping your kitten healthy and preventing disease.</p>
        <div class="custom-bullet-list">
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Kittens need a series of vaccinations to protect them from common feline diseases. Your veterinarian will recommend a vaccination schedule based on your kitten's age and health.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Deworming:</strong> Kittens are often born with intestinal parasites. Your veterinarian will recommend a deworming schedule to eliminate these parasites.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Flea and tick prevention:</strong> Protect your kitten from fleas and ticks with a veterinarian-approved preventative medication.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Desexing:</strong> Your kitten will already be desexed by the time your kitten is adopted. If your kitten is female and the surgery was recent, check the surgical area regularly to ensure it heals without issue.</div>
            <div class="custom-bullet-item">● <strong>Regular check-ups:</strong> Take your kitten to the veterinarian for regular check-ups to monitor their health and catch any potential problems early.</div>
